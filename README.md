# wordle

a clone of the game [wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) that i made

it uses the words pulled out of the source code early march 2022 and has a slightly different UI (although this dosent extend to the board only the menus)

the main difference and the reason why i made it in the first place is because you can do multiple words a day

i know that is the appeal of the game for some (including me) but i wanted to practice and i couldnt do that with the origanal
